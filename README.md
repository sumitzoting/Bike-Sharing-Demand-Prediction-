# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-
The following conclusions are made as per my discussion with my team, and this is my contribution.
             We observed that the highest number of bike rentals on a clear day and the lowest on a snowy or rainy day. The top 5 important features of our dataset are: Season_winter, Temperature, Hour, Season_autumn, Humidity. 
              In Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, I performed on experiment Ridge Regression, Elastic net and Gradient boosting. 
              After some experiment done, we can conclude that gradient boosting and random forest regressor with using hyperparameters we got the best results.
